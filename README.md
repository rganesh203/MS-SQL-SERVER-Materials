Throughout this article, we'll explore a range of SQL interview questions and answers for practitioners at the beginner and intermediate levels. If you're looking for an overview, we've compiled some top tips below:

For beginners
General questions. Expect questions about your experience, the SQL flavors you're familiar with, and your level of proficiency.
Technical questions. These will cover the basics of SQL, such as what it is, its applications, SQL statements, SQL commands, and types of SQL queries, among others.
For intermediate practitioners
Functions in SQL. You should know about aggregate and scalar functions, as well as built-in and user-defined functions.
Advanced commands. Questions may cover topics like joins, primary and foreign keys, indexes, and SQL relationships.
Database design. Expect questions on normalization, denormalization, and the differences between various SQL statements like DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP.
Advanced queries. You may be asked about subqueries, both nested and correlated, as well as how to perform specific tasks like finding the nth highest value in a column.
General SQL Interview Questions for Beginners
Before asking you technical questions, your interviewer may ask you some general questions about your overall experience with SQL. You can expect the following questions:

What SQL flavors are you familiar with?
How can you estimate your level of proficiency in SQL?
For how long have you been working in SQL?
While this information can be mentioned in your resume, be ready to talk about it. Naturally, there are no "right" answers to such questions, and there is no need to make up things when answering them.

Don't worry if your experience in SQL is limited: this is something your interviewer, most probably, already knows from your resume. Since they are interested in talking to you anyway, your profile was considered a good fit for their company.

Also, it's perfectly fine if you have only worked with one SQL flavor. Remember that all SQL dialects are fairly similar. Therefore, being familiar with only one of them is a solid basis for you to learn any others.
